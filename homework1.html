            <p>
                IT is a shape-shifting creature known as a <strong>Glamour</strong> who is billions of<br>
                years old. Although It lived on planet Earth for many years, IT originated<br>
                in a void/dimension outside the regions of space known as the<br>
                <strong>Macroverse</strong>. Since ITs true identity is unclear, due to its shape-shifting<br>
                abilities and being from another universe, ITs real name and species are<br>
                called <strong>Deadlights</strong>, but few know this, which is why it is referred to as IT.<br>
                The form of a female spider seems to be ITs true physical form on Earth<br>
                (or at least that is the closest thing the human mind can comprehend),<br>
                living deep below the fictional town of <strong>Derry, Maine</strong>. IT can morph into<br>
                any other human animal, nonhuman animal or object (including<br>
                combinations thereof). This ability is useful for, A) appearing as the<br>
                target's loved ones or friends to manipulate them or lure them into a trap<br>
                or B) appearing as the target's worst psychological fear. However, ITs<br>
                favorite and most common form is that of a circus performer named<br>
                "Pennywise the Dancing Clown," as most small children love a clown<br>
                and generally, it seems that the people in Derry happily accepted the<br>
                presence of a stray circus performer. At the same time, many people are<br>
                afraid of clowns, making them an easy fear to exploit.
            </p>

            <p>ITs real name (if indeed, it has one) is unknown. Although, several times in the novel, IT calls itself by the name<br>
               Robert “Bob” Gray. This may be an allusion to real-life child cannibal Albert Fish, who reportedly used the name<br>
               "Robert Gray" as an alias. He may also get his first name from Robert "Bob" Bell, the man who originally<br> 
               portrayed Bozo the clown.
            </p> 
            <p>      
               ITs primary goal is to feed on humans, generally preferring children over adults since they were easier to scare<br>
               and manipulate. According to the creature, frightened flesh tastes better and uses fear to "salt the meat".

                IT originated in an undiscovered void containing and surrounding our entire Universe, another far off universe<br>
                referred to as the "Macroverse." (A concept related to Todash Darkness from The <strong>Dark Tower Novels</strong>).<br>

                Other" (who may be the entity <strong>Gan</strong>). This "Other" helps the defeat of it at the end, and may also be responsible<br>
                for the creation of "<strong>The Turtle</strong>", who is It's natural enemy. In It the novel, the Turtle refers to IT as his "brother".<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                IT may be one of, or a <strong>Twinner</strong> of, the six greater demon elementals mentioned by Mia in <strong>Song of Susannah</strong>(as<br>
                the Spider is not one of the Beam Guardians). It's possible that there are other creatures of the same species as<br>
                IT, due to the fact that IT is revealed to be pregnant.

                IT arrived on Earth in a massive cataclysmic event similar to an asteroid impact, landing in a location in North<br>
                America that would eventually become <strong>Derry, Maine</strong>. Once people settled over this location, IT adopted its usual<br> 
                pattern of a 25-27 year hibernation, waking to kill and eat. Each awakening and return to hibernation is<br> 
                sometimes marked by a violent and tragic act, such as a mass murder, suicide or weather event. In the period<br> 
                between, a series of child murders occurring in Derry are never taken too seriously or solved. It is outwardly<br>
                explained that a series of murders, no matter how gruesome, don't get reported if they happen in the small<br>
                town. However, the real reason is that the influence of It prevents anyone from investigating too deeply.<br>

                27 years after the events of the first film, It resurfaces when a group of homophobic teenagers beat up and toss<br> 
                a gay man named Adrian Mellon off the bridge. He then slaughters Adrian in front of his lover before presumably<br>
                using his blood to write a message to Mike about its return. As such, It wasted no time in hunting the children of<br>
                Derry, such as when it uses empathy to lure a young girl named Victoria into getting closer to it under the false<br>
                assumption that he'd help make the birthmark on her face disappear. To further torment Bill, It sends him a<br>
                skateboard, explicitly letting him know that it was going to go after the young Dean next. Realizing that Dean<br>
                was heading to the carnival, he chases after him into the hall of mirrors. Unfortunately, It gets the upper hand<br>
                and gruesomely kills the young boy in front of him. Horrified to have lost another young boy after Georgie, Bill<br>
                decides to head to the Neibolt house to personally kill It after Henry wounds Mike and Eddie.<br>

                After each member of the Losers Club went down their own quests to retrieve artifacts from their pasts to<br>
                complete the Ritual of Chud, the ritual seems to work when it traps Its deadlights inside of the vase, but it goes<br> 
                awry. A giant version of Pennywise emerges, revealing that the original natives who had performed the ritual<br>
                were immediately slaughtered by It. This version of It is a combination of its default form Pennywise the<br>
                Dancing Clown and the Giant Spider as described in the book. It then warps the Losers Club into different<br>
                nightmarish scenarios, but they inevitably overcome their fears. It traps Richie in its deadlights, forcing Eddie to<br> 
                grab the pole Beverly gave him earlier and attacks Pennywise with it under the belief that it could kill It.<br>
                Unfortunately, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of its spiderlike appendages, swings him around like a ragdoll,<br>
                and tosses him, leaving him with a large wound in his abdomen.<br>

                This one act proves to be its undoing, however, when the Losers Club realize that in order to defeat it, they had<br>
                to make it believe it was smaller. Despite its insistence that it was the "eater of worlds," the remaining Losers<br>
                insult the clown repeatedly until It is forced into a smaller, infantile form. It attempts to lash out at Mike, but is<br> 
                too weakened. To its horror, Mike reaches into its chest and grabs its beating heart. It tries to grab it to no avail,<br>
                and is left crying like a baby, its final words being "Look at you...you've all grown up!" with weak laughter.

            <p>
                The Losers each mutually take ahold of the heart and crush it slowly. It reacts in pain until the heart exploded<br>
                into a pasty substance, killing it and avenging everything IT has caused. It falls silent as its body turning to ash.<br> 
                After its death, Richie tries to coerce Eddie's corpse awake, not accepting that he was truly gone. His attempts<br>
                of taking the body with him fail when Its lair and the Neibolt house start to crumble and collapse in response to<br>
                its master's demise. The Losers are forced to leave Eddie's body in It's lair, and the Neibolt house collapses on<br>
                itself, sinking into a hole in the ground.<br>

                No one knows the true form of IT since it first existed in an inter-<br>
                dimensional realm referred to as "deadlights". Bill Denbrough comes<br>
                close to see the "deadlights", but defeats IT before this happens.<br>
                The true form of the "deadlights" exists outside the physical realm.<br>
                Any living being that sees the "deadlights" goes insane almost instantly.<br> 
                Bill comes dangerously close to seeing the deadlights and the shape<br>
                behind the shape for a brief moment. He described IT as an endless,<br>

            <p>
                Throughout the novel, IT is generally referred to as male; however, late in the novel, the characters come to<br>
                realize that IT is most likely female, due to its true form in the physical realm being that of a giant pregnant<br>
                female spider. This revelation prompts Audra Denbrough to say, "Oh, dear Jesus, IT is female." This, however, is<br>
                not its true form; it's just the closest representation of it in our universe. Due to its pregnancy, it’s very possible<br> 
                that a male of the same species as IT existed at one time.<br>
